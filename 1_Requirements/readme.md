## Research

It is the flagship site of the Stack Exchange Network, created in 2008 by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky. It features questions and answers on a wide range of topics in computer programming.


## Ageing - Time, Feature and Costing
Time | Feature | Cost (per person)
------|----------|---------
Before | Experts Exchange was the first go-to forum for programmer | 4-5$ per month
in 2008 | stack overflow  was created for better user experience | 6-7$ per month 
In present |  Ask me !! - with more user friendly and features like upvote | 

## Ageing - Feature Evolution
* In past people use expert exchange forum to ask questions but it'd show the Googlebot the entire question and answers, but a regular visitor would just find scrambled answers, with instructions to pay to see the required results!
*	later then stack overflow came into the market. it allows other people to give answers but it doesn't validates the answers if they are correct or not
*	Now, we have Ask me!! web app which also allows people to ask questions and answers and also people can validate the answers with upvote feature
*	in future AI ML technologies can be added to filter out the different and validate the answers to similar questions
